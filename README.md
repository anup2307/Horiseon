# Horiseon-Challenge-week1
## Descripton
Refactoring existing code of the Horiseon website to meet a certain set of standards make it more accessible.  For example, all links should be functioning correctly. we can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
## User Story
